title: Fun with Device Files, TTYs, and File Permissions

## /dev/

I was reading a bit about `/dev/` and device files.

There are a bunch of different devices and you can `ls -lh /dev/` to show some of them. Here are a few on my laptop:
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ ls -lh /dev/
total 0
crw------- 1 root root     10, 235 May  1 12:18 autofs
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root         260 May  1 12:17 block
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root          80 May  1 12:17 bsg
crw-rw---- 1 root disk     10, 237 May  1 12:18 loop-control
brw-rw---- 1 root disk      7,   0 May  1 12:18 loop0
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root      1,   3 May  1 12:18 null
crw------- 1 root root     10,   1 May  1 12:18 psaux
crw-rw-rw- 1 root tty       5,   2 May  1 13:08 ptmx
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root           0 May  1 12:17 pts
brw-rw---- 1 root disk      8,   0 May  1 12:18 sda
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root          15 May  1 12:17 stderr -> /proc/self/fd/2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root          15 May  1 12:17 stdin -> /proc/self/fd/0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root          15 May  1 12:17 stdout -> /proc/self/fd/1
crw-rw-rw- 1 root tty       5,   0 May  1 12:18 tty
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout   4,  65 May  1 12:18 ttyS1
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root      1,   9 May  1 12:18 urandom
crw-rw---- 1 root tty       7,   0 May  1 12:18 vcs
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root      1,   5 May  1 12:18 zero
```

You might recognize some of them, especially `stdin`, `stdout`, `urandom`, and `null`. Here is an [overview](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/dev-fs.html) of some of the devices found in `/dev/`.

Another thing I want to point out is the first character of each line, the file type. You may be familiar with `-` for regular files, `d` for directories, and `l` for symbolic links. In this list you will also see `c` for character devices and `b` for block devices. Everything is a file in UNIX, even devices. There are [other file types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types), as well, like `p` for named pipes and `s` for sockets.

## TTYs

I'm going to focus on the `c` character devices. In particular, you'll notice that `pts`, `tty`, and `ttyS1` (all types of terminals) are character devices.

Cool! So, if each terminal is just a file, if I want to send a message to another terminal can I just write to it?

```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ tty
/dev/pts/0
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ echo "Hi /dev/pts/1!" > /dev/pts/1
```
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ tty
/dev/pts/1
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ Hi /dev/pts/1!
```

Awesome. I can even send the bell character `\a` to make the other terminal ring.
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ tty
/dev/pts/1
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ echo -e 'Hey /dev/pts/0! \a' > /dev/pts/0
```
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ tty
/dev/pts/0
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ Hey /dev/pts/0! <ding!>
```

## File permissions

Fun. But I'm just sending myself messages (since both terminals are the `vagrant` user).

I added another user `tnargav` which is using `pts/1`:
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ who
vagrant  pts/0        May  2 02:11 (10.0.2.2)
tnargav  pts/1        May  2 02:14 (10.0.2.2)
```

Let's try it out:
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ echo "Hi /dev/pts/1!" > /dev/pts/1
-bash: /dev/pts/1: Permission denied
```

Boo. Okay, that makes sense though, I shouldn't be able to just send another user messages.

What if I update the file permissions?
```
tnargav@ubuntu-xenial:~$ chmod a+w /dev/pts/1
```
```
vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ echo "Hi tnargav!" > /dev/pts/1
```
```
tnargav@ubuntu-xenial:~$ Hi tnargav!
```

Neat, no magic here, just standard UNIX file permissions.

## write(1)

I think most systems have [`write(1)`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/write) which allows you to send messages to another user. A quick peek at the source code and it seems like it checks group permissions.
